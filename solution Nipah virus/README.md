Nipah virus is aÂ zoonotic virusÂ that can be transmitted from animals to humans.Â It was first identified in 1999 during an outbreak among pig farmers in Malaysia. There is no treatment or vaccine available for either people or animals.Â 
In September 2023, India reported a Nipah virus outbreak in Kerala.Â The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India implemented public health response measures to contain the outbreak

##  Personal Reason

"As I am learning soft computing in my college, one day I decided to get some practical knowledge for the same. Through YouTube, I got to know about the 'machine-learning concept and its implementation'. In this, I learned about 'random forest regression' and 'logistic regression'. My curiosity led me to implement a simple model.
## Objective

 - The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can predict the probability of Nipah virus infection in individuals based on their demographic and clinical data. The model will be trained on a dataset of confirmed Nipah virus cases and healthy controls, and will be evaluated using cross-validation techniques.



## The project will involve the following steps:

- Data collection: Collect demographic and clinical data from confirmed Nipah virus cases and healthy controls.

- Data preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data to remove missing values, outliers, and other errors.

- Feature engineering: Extract relevant features from the data that can be used to predict Nipah virus infection.

- Model selection: Select an appropriate machine learning algorithm for the task.

- Model training: Train the selected model on the preprocessed data.

- Model evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the model using cross-validation techniques.

- Model deployment: Deploy the trained model to a web application or other platform for use by healthcare professionals.
